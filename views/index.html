		<p>Let me tell you a little about myself, I am from Cuernavaca, Morelos Mexico, I came to the US when I was about 14. Unlike other people that come to this country I came here without any prior knowledge of the English language. Within a year I found myself fitting into this culture. Anyways what I really want to tell you is how my interest for computers started. In 2006 I bought my first computer, not from the store but at a garage sell since that was all I could afford. I bought it because I wanted to type out my homework so it could look nice. Soon after I had enough money saved for a printer and bought it, right when I was installing it, a message showed up on the screen saying I needed more space. I took it to a local computer repair shop, and they fixed my problem and my pocket too. I visited that place very often after that one time. For different reasons of course, lack of ram, memory, etc. Ever since then I been interested to see how things actually work in reality. I was eager to learn about this magic machines. Yeah, that's how my passion started.</p>
